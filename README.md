# Strassen Matrix Multiplication

This project implements Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication and compares its performance to the brute-force method.
The program is written in C and determines the optimal crossover point for switching between Strassen's algorithm and the brute-force method.

|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bin`        | Contains the compiled binary executable of the program.                |
| `data`       | Stores the input files containing the matrices in CSV format.          |
| `include`    | Contains header files (`.h`) with function prototypes and necessary<br>type or constant definitions. |
| `output`     | Stores the output files generated by the program, such as the<br>resulting matrix after multiplication. |
| `results`    | Stores the results of the experiments, such as runtime analysis,<br>graphs, and spreadsheets. |
| `src`        | Contains the source code files (`.c`).                                  |

### data

This folder contains two example CSV files with matrices as well as<br>the `create_csv` generated matrix data to be used as input data for the program.

### src

This folder contains the following source code files:

| File          | Description                                                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.c`      | Contains the main function to run the program and perform the experiments. |
| `matrix.c`    | Handles reading and writing matrices from/to CSV files,<br>and other matrix-related utilities. |
| `brute_force.c` | Implements the brute-force matrix multiplication algorithm.        |
| `crossover.c`  | Implements the crossover algorithm that switches<br>between Strassen's and brute-force methods based on the given crossover point. |
| `strassen.c`  | Implements Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm.                |
| `create_csv.c` | Implements the functionality to generate CSV files with random<br>matrices for testing purposes. |


### Generating Random Matrix CSV Files

The `create_csv` program allows you to generate random matrix CSV files for testing purposes.<br>To build and run the `create_csv` program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., `gcc`).
2. Navigate to the project root directory (`strassen_matrix_multiplication`).
3. Run `make` to compile the project. The binary executable will be placed in the `bin` folder.
4. Run the `create_csv` program using the following command:

```bash
./bin/create_csv [n] [pairs]
```

To run the `create_csv` program, you will need to specify the following arguments:

`[n]`: the size of the matrix in the form of 2^n x 2^n<br>
`[pairs]`: the number of matrix pairs to generate<br>
The generated CSV file will be saved in the data folder with a<br>default naming convention: matrix-`[pairs]`-pairs-of-`[rows]`x`[cols]`.csv.

## Building and Running the Project

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., `gcc`).
2. Navigate to the project root directory (`strassen_matrix_multiplication`).
3. Run `make` to compile the project. The binary executable will be placed in the `bin` folder.
4. Run the program using the following command:

```bash
./bin/matrix_app [input_file] [output_file] [crossover_point] [n_dimensions]
```

To run the `matrix_app` program, you will need to specify the following arguments:

- `[input_file]`: the path to the input file
- `[output_file]`: the path to the output file
- `[crossover_point]`: the crossover point for the genetic algorithm
- `[n_dimensions]`: the size of the matrix in the form of 2^n x 2^n
